# Quizzical Trivia

This is a practice project for Learn React course on Scrimba.

## Requirements

- Two screens (start & questions)
- Pull 5 questions from the OTDB API
- Tally correct answers after "Check answers" is clicked
- Styled & polished

The design is refer to [Scrimba's Figma prototype](<https://www.figma.com/file/uhSmbPGj9niY2NN7ENwkzT/Quizzical-App-(Copy)?node-id=8%3A2>), I think it's part of requirements.

The quizs I choose to get from Trivia API is: general knowledge, any difficulty, and any type.
